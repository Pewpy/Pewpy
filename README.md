# About Me

I started programming at the tender age of 17 and only a couple years later, I was able to secure an internship at a local video game development company. Having code I programmed make it into the final release of the game was a pretty neat experience. Now, I just code for fun and myself.

## Skills

Semi-actively work with <code>C#</code>, <code>Python</code> and just started with <code>.NET MAUI</code> -  solving problems that fit the needs of none. Programming in <code>C</code> was a lot of fun, but I'm told that there's no real reason to use it anymore. I use <code>Visual Studio 2022</code> for my IDE, on account that it's auto-complete is top notch.


## Projects

I have contributed to 6 titles in the video game industry over five years. (contributing code to only one) and I plan on adding 0 more titles in the near future. Currently, I'm creating programs that will never see the light of day, unless someone takes my hard drives after I pass.
